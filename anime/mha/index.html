                <p class="text-lg mb-4">The world of My Hero Academia was once similar to ours until a baby was born with the ability to glow. Soon after, humans began to manifest special abilities known as "Quirks," plunging the world into chaos. Now, stability and peace have been restored, with 80% of the population possessing Quirks.</p>
                <p class="text-lg mb-4">The use of Quirks in public is generally prohibited to ensure civilian safety. Those who use their gifts for selfish gain are branded as "Villains." In contrast, "Heroes" are formalized civil servants who use their Quirks to protect the populace, assist in disaster relief, and collaborate with police to solve crimes.</p>
                <p class="text-lg">All Might, the greatest hero, is the "Pillar of Peace" responsible for the current golden age. However, his critical injuries mean he will soon retire, and a rising darkness, led by charismatic villains like All For One, threatens society's fragile peace.</p>
                <p class="text-lg mt-4">The story begins ten months before U.A. High's next Entrance Exam, coinciding with All Might's first meeting with Izuku Midoriya, a Quirkless boy aspiring to be a hero.</p>

                <li><strong>Bitter Rivalry (+100CP):</strong> Gain a rival that's literally impossible to get rid of permanently; careers always draw you together, attempts to kill them fail, persistent annoyance.</li>
                <li><strong>Villainous Vibes (+100CP):</strong> Your personal aesthetics and Quirk cause most people to make a snap judgment of "villain," making them wary even if you're a hero.</li>
                <li><strong>Quirky (+100CP):</strong> Your Quirk gains a peculiar, negative quirk of its own (e.g., certain foods cause misfires, explosive temper linked to Quirk, bizarre activation conditions).</li>
                <li><strong>Crutch (+200CP):</strong> Terrible experience leaves you crippled (e.g., lost limb), granted a prosthetic that is never truly the same, cannot take as much abuse, limits potential.</li>
                <li><strong>Quirk Singularity (+200CP):</strong> Visible display of Quirk Singularity threats; suffer health complications with Quirk use (e.g., Dabi's flames burning you, Nines' cellular decay), must forego or pace Quirk use.</li>
                <li><strong>Quirkless (+200CP):</strong> No Quirk, treated as a second-class citizen; purchased/customized Quirk locked for duration, cannot hide this fact. (Mutually incompatible with any Quirk driven drawback).</li>
                <li><strong>Evil Seed (+300CP):</strong> Served All For One, in his pocket; he has your number (suicide bomb Quirk, hold on reputation), can lead to downfall; low expectations mean minor tasks, but waves mean intrusive demands.</li>
                <li><strong>Distortion of Fate (+300CP):</strong> Perception and belief hold strange weight on your life; more people know you, more negative wants influence circumstances to make you fail.</li>
                <li><strong>Growing Pains (+300CP):</strong> Awaken from comatose state with eroded body/abilities (agonizing pain, mental blocks); exist as a fraction, but rehabilitation can reclaim what's lost.</li>

                <li><strong>Pillar of Peace:</strong> Subsume Midoriya's role as inheritor of One For All; All Might loses powers, you must fill his shoes as symbol of peace, earning recognition quickly to stem darkness. Failure: Chain ends, left behind. Success: Keep One For All.</li>
                <li><strong>Stain's Legacy:</strong> Fall in step with Stain's message to clean the world of "false heroes"; systematically slaughter/cripple or infiltrate system. Opposed by heroes/society. 10 years to succeed. Failure: No reward. Success: Spread message like unstoppable wildfire, swaying likeminded people.</li>
                <li><strong>Big Bad Conspiracy:</strong> Learn All For One's arrest was a clone, true AFO made clean getaway; no one in power believes you except "outcasts" (Quirkless, thugs).
